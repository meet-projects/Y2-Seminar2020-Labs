## Repl.it Setup:
* First, we'll need to set up our **Repl.it** environment:
    1. **Account Creation:**
        1. Go to https://Repl.it/ and click on **Sign Up** (Top-right).
        1. Fill in your username, email, and password... make sure your email is valid and accessible.
        1. After signing up, you will be asked to fill more info to complete your account, this step is optional.
        1. When done, a **verification email** will be sent to your email in 5-10 minutes, wait for it, and click on **"Verify"** when you get the email.
        1. That's it!
    1. **Environment Setup:**
        1. Click on **"+new Repl"** (Top-right): This will create a new file for you to code in!
        1. Choose "HTML/CSS/JS" as the programming language.
        1. Name your Repl **"Lab 1"**
        1. Click on "Create Repl"
            - This is how you'll be creating a new Repl.it
        1. Now you can see the **Editor** and **Console** in front of you!
        1. Now you can start writing your code and running it!!!
        1. Make sure for each lab: you create a new Repl.it and call it according to the day number.
        1. We'll teach you how to submit your work later on :)



**Now we're done with setting up our programming environment, let's get back to our [lab](https://github.com/meet-projects/Y2-Seminar2020-Labs/blob/master/Day%201,%20Session%201,%20Intro%20to%20Summer/README.md).**
