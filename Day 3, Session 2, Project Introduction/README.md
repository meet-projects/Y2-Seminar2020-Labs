# Project Document



## Your final outcome:
- You will build your first *dynamic* **web application** combining all of the CS tools you learned so far!


## Project Plan:
In this challenge, you will design and build a **full scale web application!** that uses one of these **APIs**:  
- [BreezoMeter](https://breezometer.com/products/air-quality-api)
- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com)
- [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov)
- [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com)
- [TLV Open Data](https://opendata.tel-aviv.gov.il/en/pages/home.aspx)
- [Palestinian Open Data](http://sdg-pcbs.opendata.arcgis.com)
- [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/overview/)



## Requirements:
Final Outcome:
- User Interactivity
- Uses Flask (Routing & Forms)
- Use an API (Choose one from the provided list)

### Bonus:
- Uses Bootstrap
- Deployed on Heroku * *(We will help you deploy it!)*  

### Should be submitted with: 
- Storyboard & Wireframe
- Planning Document *(if any)*  


## Why should you care?
You learned about Front-end (HTML, CSS and JS) and Back-end (Python, Flask and APIs). Now it’s time to put all of this knowledge combined together to the test!  
The best way to practice and solidify all of these new concept in programming is to actually implement it, so this project gives you a chance to make practical use of what you’ve learned.
This is your chance to show us what you’re passionate about using CS only, you can show off your skills and still focus on your website’s topic using your creativity!  


## Teamwork:  
  
***Pair* Programming** is a really important skill.  
I know sometimes it’s uncomfortable to work in groups, but as a developer, you work together all the time.  
When you build an app, you will never be building and creating by yourself. You might be using a blog post, or a stack overflow question, or asking a friend and in some capacity you will be working with other people.  
There is a concept called **pair programming** that’s used in industry, where *two developers* work together on <u>one computer</u>.  
One is **the driver**, who types, and the other is **the navigator** who tells the driver what to type.  
It should be a conversation, we should hear talking in the room when you work together, it should be **collaborative**.  
A lot of tech companies use **pair programming** during the interview process to see if you can get along with their developers. It’s a really important skill to be able to *work together*.  


### >>> 1 + 1 = 3
> When does this happen?  
</br>  

This happens as a result to **Effective Teamwork!**  

> The **whole** is *greater* than the **sum** of its parts.  
  
- Turn to your partner, "what does it mean to be an effective team member?"  
</br>  

Some effective teamwork ***characteristics***:
- listening
- humility
- patience
- compassion
- generosity
- empathy
- clarity and thoughtful communication
- joy  
</br>  


## Brainstorming:  
1. Brainstorm a topic the website revolves around and a name for the website.
- Can be on paper & pen or a tool of your choice. *Make sure to save your documentation somewhere safe as you'll have to submit it!*

### Hypothetical Projects You could do! (To get your brain running)
+ A web application that gives you live alerts of current fires in a selected area.
+ A web application that finds you the most suitable available job.
+ A web application that gives you information about weather and air quality, in a specified location.


### Project Samples: (Also to get your brain running)
- [TBD]()
- [TBD]()  


## Storyboarding & Wireframing:
1. Draw the storyboards and wireframe of your different pages!  
- Can be on an online wireframing tool of your choice (such as [NinjaMock](https://ninjamock.com/)).
- For getting a color scheme, here's a [useful website](https://coolors.co/)  
- Wireframe example:

## Building/Workflow:
1. Brainstorming
2. Storyboarding & Wireframing *(encouraged)* + Choosing a color scheme *(optional)*
3. Implementation (Coding + building everything together)
